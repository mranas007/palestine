                        religious sites in Islam. Located in the Old City of Jerusalem, it holds deep religious and
                        historical importance for Muslims worldwide. Here is a brief overview of the Al-Aqsa Mosque:

                        <h3>Historical Significance :</h3>
                        <li>Al-Aqsa Mosque is considered the third holiest site in Islam, after the Kaaba in Mecca and
                            the Prophet's Mosque in Medina. It is often mentioned in the Quran and Hadith, making it a
                            place of great reverence for Muslims.</li>
                        <h3>Location :</h3>
                        <li>The mosque is situated in the Old City of Jerusalem, within the compound known as the
                            Al-Haram Al-Sharif, or the Noble Sanctuary. It shares this compound with the Dome of the
                            Rock, another iconic Islamic monument.</li>

                    <h3>Architecture :</h3>
                    <li>The current structure of Al-Aqsa Mosque is an impressive example of Islamic architecture,
                        with multiple domes, arches, and intricate design elements. The mosque complex covers a
                        large area and includes open courtyards, prayer halls, and other facilities.</li>
                    <h3>History : </h3>
                    <li>The history of Al-Aqsa Mosque dates back to the early Islamic period. It was initially built
                        in the 7th century, then expanded and renovated over the centuries. It has seen various
                        rulers, including the Umayyads, Abbasids, Fatimids, Crusaders, and Ottoman Empire, leave
                        their mark on its architecture</li>
                    <h3>Religious Significance :</h3>
                    <li>For Muslims, Al-Aqsa Mosque is believed to be the place where the Prophet Muhammad was
                        transported during the Night Journey (Isra and Mi'raj), a miraculous event described in
                        Islamic tradition. It is also where Muslims believe that the Prophet led other prophets in
                        prayer.</li>
                    <h3>Current Status :</h3>
                    <li>Al-Aqsa Mosque is under the administration of the Islamic Waqf, a religious trust. It is
                        situated in a highly sensitive and contested area, as it shares the Noble Sanctuary with the
                        Western Wall, a sacred site in Judaism, and is a focal point in the Israeli-Palestinian
                        conflict.</li>
                    <h3>Access Restrictions :</h3>
                    <li>Due to the complex political and religious situation in the region, there have been periods
                        of tension and restrictions on access to Al-Aqsa Mosque for Muslims and non-Muslims alike.
                        These access restrictions have resulted in various disputes and conflicts over the years.
